## About

**Version:** 0.0.1

**Web:** Coming later, [neap.io](http://neap.io)

**Project Owner:** MichaÃ«l "[e7d](https://github.com/e7d)" Ferrand

## Prerequisites

In order to run the Neap Box effectively, you'll need to have a few tools installed:
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
1. Install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)
1. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

### Windows-specific ###

1. Add the Git executables to your path
1. Install [Vagrant::WinNFSd](https://github.com/winnfsd/vagrant-winnfsd), to use NFS on a Windows host  
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd`

### Recommended

1. Use a development workstation with at least 2 cores and 8GB of RAM, as Vagrant should be allocated 1GB of RAM
1. Install [Vagrant::VBGuest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest), to manage the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system  
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`

## Installation ##

1. `git clone https://github.com/e7d/neap-box.git` to clone the latest version
1. Change into the directory `neap-box`
1. Run `vagrant up`

## Update ##

1. `git pull` to get the latest version of the code
1. Change into the directory `neap-box`
1. Run `vagrant reload`
1. Run `vagrant provision`

For a complete update from scratch, destroying and rebuilding everything:

## What you get ##

### Software stack ###

Neap uses a mixture of Vagrant's [shell provisioner](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/shell.html) to kick things off.

Once Vagrant is done provisioning the VM, you will have a box running Debian 8 (aka Jessie) containing:

* [Nginx](http://nginx.com/), as web server, with:
  * [Nginx RTMP module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module), as streaming server (RTMP, HLS and DASH protocols)
  * [PHP 7.0](http://php.net/), as web scripting language, with:
    * [PHP-FPM](http://php-fpm.org/), as PHP process manager
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), as database
* [UnrealIRCd](https://www.unrealircd.org/), as IRC server daemon, with:
  * [Anope](https://www.anope.org/), as IRC services
* Soon: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), as SSL certificate generator
* Soon: [Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/), as static files cache
* Soon: [Memcached](http://memcached.org/), as memory object cache
